# Deep-Learning
Learnt about Neural Networks (Weights , Bias , Activation Function , Forward Propagation , Backward Propagation , Gradient Descent , Cost Function)

Activation Functions(Learnt about Linear , Softmax , Sigmoid , Relu ,Leaky Relu)

Gradient Descent (Learnt about various optimizers like Stochastic radient Descent , Mini Batch SGD , RMSProp , Adam , Adamax , Adadelta , Adagrad)

Cost Functions (Learnt about MSE , Absolute MSE , RMSE , BinaryCrossEntropy)

Also learnt about reducing overfitting problems with help of techniques like Batch Normalization , Dropouts , Callbacks 

Understood the mathematical intution behind important feature engineering concepts like Countvectorisation , TFIDF transformation , word2vec also models like 
Bag of words & word embedding.
